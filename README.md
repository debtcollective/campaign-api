## Pre-requisites

You need to have postgresql in your machine, this project expect you to have two databases one for development and another to test environment check [knexfile.js](knexfile.js) to check the databases name.

If you don't have postgresql installed or/and you don't know how to create a database you can refer to [this blog post](https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb) that can help you to setup everything up.

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

Runs the service that expose a GraphQL endpoint.

```sh
yarn start
```

## Run tests

The tests drop the current database for testing *(so you need to have even a empty database of testing created)* and create a new one to be populated with the fake data to make the assertions.

```sh
yarn test
```
